          <p>
            Void Linux is the best Linux distro I had ever used. It&rsquo;s
            fast, simple, it has its own package manager (holy shit, it is
            awesome) and a small but growing community. It has been used by many
            ricers because of it&rsquo;s simplicity. That is why I chose Void as
            an alternative to Artix (non-systemd Arch). Everything Void provides
            should work right out of the box. But you know what doesn&rsquo;t?
            It&rsquo;s the audio.
          </p>
          <h2 id="alsa">ALSA</h2>
          <p>
            This is old, it was initially released in 1998, but it is still
            being updated and used by Linux community. It provides an API for
            sound card device drives and a part of the Linux kernel. You could
            use it directly, but I recommend not to since there are many sound
            servers that was built on top of ALSA and they provide easier
            configuration and more options for users.
          </p>

            It&rsquo;s installation process is actually straight-forward. At
            first, add yourself into the <code>audio</code> group.
